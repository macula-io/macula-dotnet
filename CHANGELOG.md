# Changelog

All notable changes to `Macula`, this repository's NuGet package, are
documented here. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/). The package is
pre-1.0, so a minor version may carry a small breaking change; each one is
called out below. Releases before 0.4.1 predate this file; see the git tags.

## [0.4.1] - Unreleased

### Fixed

- **Sends that overlap on one session no longer fail.** System.Net.Quic
  rejects a write that starts while another is still pending, and nothing
  serialized the frames a `Session` sends, so in 0.4.0 two tasks sending at
  once could fail a send, a publish for example, with
  `InvalidOperationException`. Sends on a stream now take turns, and each
  frame is still written whole.
- **`SupervisedPubSub.RunPublisherAsync` sends `pubsub.publish_started_v1`
  before the publish, not beside it.** In 0.4.0 the fact was sent without
  waiting for it, so it could fail the publish with
  `InvalidOperationException` or be lost. It is now sent and finished
  first, then the publish, then `pubsub.publish_completed_v1`. A fact that
  fails to send still never fails the publish.
